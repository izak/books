<body><p>The Stoics say, "Retire within yourselves; it is there you will find your rest." And that is not true.</p>
<p>Others say, "Go out of yourselves; seek happiness in amusement." And this is not true. Illness comes.</p>
<p>Happiness is neither without us nor within us. It is in God, both without us and within us.</p>

<p>Had Epictetus seen the way perfectly, he would have said to men, "You follow a wrong road"; he shows that there is another, but he does not lead to it. It is the way of willing what God wills. Jesus Christ alone leads to it: <i>Via, veritas.</i><a id="FNanchor_175_179"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_175_179" class="fnanchor pginternal">[175]</a></p>

<p>No other religion has proposed to men to hate themselves. No other religion then can please those who hate themselves, and who seek a Being truly lovable. And these, if they had never heard of the religion of a God humiliated, would embrace it at once.</p>

<p>I feel that I might not have been; for the Ego consists in my thoughts. Therefore I, who think, would not have been, if my mother had been killed before I had life. I am not then a necessary being. In the same way I am not eternal or infinite; but I see plainly that there exists in nature a necessary Being, eternal and infinite.<a id="Page_131" class="pageno" title="[Pg 131]"/></p>

<p>"Had I seen a miracle," say men, "I should become converted." How can they be sure they would do a thing of the nature of which they are ignorant? They imagine that this conversion consists in a worship of God which is like commerce, and in a communion such as they picture to themselves. True religion consists in annihilating self before that Universal Being, whom we have so often provoked, and who can justly destroy us at any time; in recognising that we can do nothing without Him, and have deserved nothing from Him but His displeasure. It consists in knowing that there is an unconquerable opposition between us and God, and that without a mediator there can be no communion with Him.</p>

<p>It is unjust that men should attach themselves to me, even though they do it with pleasure and voluntarily. I should deceive those in whom I had created this desire; for I am not the end of any, and I have not the wherewithal to satisfy them. Am I not about to die? And thus the object of their attachment will die. Therefore, as I would be blamable in causing a falsehood to be believed, though I should employ gentle persuasion, though it should be believed with pleasure, and though it should give me pleasure; even so I am blamable in making myself loved, and if I attract persons to attach themselves to me. I ought to warn those who are ready to consent to a lie, that they ought not to believe it, whatever advantage comes to me from it; and likewise that they ought not to attach themselves to me; for they ought to spend their life and their care in pleasing God, or in seeking Him.</p>

<p>Self-will will never be satisfied, though it should have command of all it would; but we are satisfied from the moment we renounce it. Without it we cannot be discontented; with it we cannot be content.</p>

<p>Let us imagine a body full of thinking members.<a id="FNanchor_178_182"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_178_182" class="fnanchor pginternal">[178]</a></p>

<p><i>Members, To commence with that.</i>—To regulate the love which we owe to ourselves, we must imagine a body full of<a id="Page_132" class="pageno" title="[Pg 132]"/> thinking members, for we are members of the whole, and must see how each member should love itself, etc....</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00492"><a id="p_475"/>475</h4>
<p>If the feet and the hands had a will of their own, they could only be in their order in submitting this particular will to the primary will which governs the whole body. Apart from that, they are in disorder and mischief; but in willing only the good of the body, they accomplish their own good.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00493"><a id="p_476"/>476</h4>
<p>We must love God only and hate self only.</p>
<p>If the foot had always been ignorant that it belonged to the body, and that there was a body on which it depended, if it had only had the knowledge and the love of self, and if it came to know that it belonged to a body on which it depended, what regret, what shame for its past life, for having been useless to the body which inspired its life, which would have annihilated it if it had rejected it and separated it from itself, as it kept itself apart from the body! What prayers for its preservation in it! And with what submission would it allow itself to be governed by the will which rules the body, even to consenting, if necessary, to be cut off, or it would lose its character as member! For every member must be quite willing to perish for the body, for which alone the whole is.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00494"><a id="p_477"/>477</h4>
<p>It is false that we are worthy of the love of others; it is unfair that we should desire it. If we were born reasonable and impartial, knowing ourselves and others, we should not give this bias to our will. However, we are born with it; therefore born unjust, for all tends to self. This is contrary to all order. We must consider the general good; and the propensity to self is the beginning of all disorder, in war, in politics, in economy, and in the particular body of man. The will is therefore depraved.</p>
<p>If the members of natural and civil communities tend towards the weal of the body, the communities themselves ought to look to another more general body of which they are members. We ought therefore to look to the whole. We are therefore born unjust and depraved.<a id="Page_133" class="pageno" title="[Pg 133]"/></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00495"><a id="p_478"/>478</h4>
<p>When we want to think of God, is there nothing which turns us away, and tempts us to think of something else? All this is bad, and is born in us.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00496"><a id="p_479"/>479</h4>
<p>If there is a God, we must love Him only, and not the creatures of a day. The reasoning of the ungodly in the book of Wisdom<a id="FNanchor_179_183"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_179_183" class="fnanchor pginternal">[179]</a> is only based upon the non-existence of God. "On that supposition," say they, "let us take delight in the creatures." That is the worst that can happen. But if there were a God to love, they would not have come to this conclusion, but to quite the contrary. And this is the conclusion of the wise: "There is a God, let us therefore not take delight in the creatures."</p>
<p>Therefore all that incites us to attach ourselves to the creatures is bad; since it prevents us from serving God if we know Him, or from seeking Him if we know Him not. Now we are full of lust. Therefore we are full of evil; therefore we ought to hate ourselves and all that excited us to attach ourselves to any other object than God only.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00497"><a id="p_480"/>480</h4>
<p>To make the members happy, they must have one will, and submit it to the body.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00498"><a id="p_481"/>481</h4>
<p>The examples of the noble deaths of the Lacedæmonians and others scarce touch us. For what good is it to us? But the example of the death of the martyrs touches us; for they are "our members." We have a common tie with them. Their resolution can form ours, not only by example, but because it has perhaps deserved ours. There is nothing of this in the examples of the heathen. We have no tie with them; as we do not become rich by seeing a stranger who is so, but in fact by seeing a father or a husband who is so.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00499"><a id="p_482"/>482</h4>
<p><i>Morality.</i>—God having made the heavens and the earth, which do not feel the happiness of their being, He has willed to make beings who should know it, and who should compose a body of thinking members. For our members do not feel the<a id="Page_134" class="pageno" title="[Pg 134]"/> happiness of their union, of their wonderful intelligence, of the care which has been taken to infuse into them minds, and to make them grow and endure. How happy they would be if they saw and felt it! But for this they would need to have intelligence to know it, and good-will to consent to that of the universal soul. But if, having received intelligence, they employed it to retain nourishment for themselves without allowing it to pass to the other members, they would hate rather than love themselves; their blessedness, as well as their duty, consisting in their consent to the guidance of the whole soul to which they belong, which loves them better than they love themselves.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00500"><a id="p_483"/>483</h4>
<p>To be a member is to have neither life, being, nor movement, except through the spirit of the body, and for the body.</p>
<p>The separate member, seeing no longer the body to which it belongs, has only a perishing and dying existence. Yet it believes it is a whole, and seeing not the body on which it depends, it believes it depends only on self, and desires to make itself both centre and body. But not having in itself a principle of life, it only goes astray, and is astonished in the uncertainty of its being; perceiving in fact that it is not a body, and still not seeing that it is a member of a body. In short, when it comes to know itself, it has returned as it were to its own home, and loves itself only for the body. It deplores its past wanderings.</p>
<p>It cannot by its nature love any other thing, except for itself and to subject it to self, because each thing loves itself more than all. But in loving the body, it loves itself, because it only exists in it, by it, and for it. <i>Qui adhæret Deo unus spiritus est.</i><a id="FNanchor_180_184"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_180_184" class="fnanchor pginternal">[180]</a></p>
<p>The body loves the hand; and the hand, if it had a will, should love itself in the same way as it is loved by the soul. All love which goes beyond this is unfair.</p>
<p><i>Adhærens Deo unus spiritus est.</i> We love ourselves, because we are members of Jesus Christ. We love Jesus Christ, because He is the body of which we are members. All is one, one is in the other, like the Three Persons.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00501"><a id="p_484"/>484</h4>
<p>Two laws<a id="FNanchor_181_185"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_181_185" class="fnanchor pginternal">[181]</a> suffice to rule the whole Christian Republic better than all the laws of statecraft.<a id="Page_135" class="pageno" title="[Pg 135]"/></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00502"><a id="p_485"/>485</h4>
<p>The true and only virtue, then, is to hate self (for we are hateful on account of lust), and to seek a truly lovable being to love. But as we cannot love what is outside ourselves, we must love a being who is in us, and is not ourselves; and that is true of each and all men. Now, only the Universal Being is such. The kingdom of God is within us;<a id="FNanchor_182_186"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_182_186" class="fnanchor pginternal">[182]</a> the universal good is within us, is ourselves—and not ourselves.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00503"><a id="p_486"/>486</h4>
<p>The dignity of man in his innocence consisted in using and having dominion over the creatures, but now in separating himself from them, and subjecting himself to them.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00504"><a id="p_487"/>487</h4>
<p>Every religion is false, which as to its faith does not worship one God as the origin of everything, and which as to its morality does not love one only God as the object of everything.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00505"><a id="p_488"/>488</h4>
<p>... But it is impossible that God should ever be the end, if He is not the beginning. We lift our eyes on high, but lean upon the sand; and the earth will dissolve, and we shall fall whilst looking at the heavens.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00506"><a id="p_489"/>489</h4>
<p>If there is one sole source of everything, there is one sole end of everything; everything through Him, everything for Him. The true religion, then, must teach us to worship Him only, and to love Him only. But as we find ourselves unable to worship what we know not, and to love any other object but ourselves, the religion which instructs us in these duties must instruct us also of this inability, and teach us also the remedies for it. It teaches us that by one man all was lost, and the bond broken between God and us, and that by one man the bond is renewed.</p>
<p>We are born so averse to this love of God, and it is so necessary that we must be born guilty, or God would be unjust.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00507"><a id="p_490"/>490</h4>
<p>Men, not being accustomed to form merit, but only to recompense it where they find it formed, judge of God by themselves.<a id="Page_136" class="pageno" title="[Pg 136]"/></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00508"><a id="p_491"/>491</h4>
<p>The true religion must have as a characteristic the obligation to love God. This is very just, and yet no other religion has commanded this; ours has done so. It must also be aware of human lust and weakness; ours is so. It must have adduced remedies for this; one is prayer. No other religion has asked of God to love and follow Him.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00509"><a id="p_492"/>492</h4>
<p>He who hates not in himself his self-love, and that instinct which leads him to make himself God, is indeed blinded. Who does not see that there is nothing so opposed to justice and truth? For it is false that we deserve this, and it is unfair and impossible to attain it, since all demand the same thing. It is, then, a manifest injustice which is innate in us, of which we cannot get rid, and of which we must get rid.</p>
<p>Yet no religion has indicated that this was a sin; or that we were born in it; or that we were obliged to resist it; or has thought of giving us remedies for it.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00510"><a id="p_493"/>493</h4>
<p>The true religion teaches our duties; our weaknesses, pride, and lust; and the remedies, humility and mortification.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00511"><a id="p_494"/>494</h4>
<p>The true religion must teach greatness and misery; must lead to the esteem and contempt of self, to love and to hate.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00512"><a id="p_495"/>495</h4>
<p>If it is an extraordinary blindness to live without investigating what we are, it is a terrible one to live an evil life, while believing in God.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00513"><a id="p_496"/>496</h4>
<p>Experience makes us see an enormous difference between piety and goodness.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00514"><a id="p_497"/>497</h4>
<p><i>Against those who, trusting to the mercy of God, live heedlessly, without doing good works.</i>—As the two sources of our sins are pride and sloth, God has revealed to us two of His attributes to cure them, mercy and justice. The property of justice is to<a id="Page_137" class="pageno" title="[Pg 137]"/> humble pride, however holy may be our works, <i>et non intres in judicium</i>,<a id="FNanchor_183_187"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_183_187" class="fnanchor pginternal">[183]</a> etc.; and the property of mercy is to combat sloth by exhorting to good works, according to that passage: "The goodness of God leadeth to repentance,"<a id="FNanchor_184_188"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_184_188" class="fnanchor pginternal">[184]</a> and that other of the Ninevites: "Let us do penance to see if peradventure He will pity us."<a id="FNanchor_185_189"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_185_189" class="fnanchor pginternal">[185]</a> And thus mercy is so far from authorising slackness, that it is on the contrary the quality which formally attacks it; so that instead of saying, "If there were no mercy in God we should have to make every kind of effort after virtue," we must say, on the contrary, that it is because there is mercy in God, that we must make every kind of effort.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00515"><a id="p_498"/>498</h4>
<p>It is true there is difficulty in entering into godliness. But this difficulty does not arise from the religion which begins in us, but from the irreligion which is still there. If our senses were not opposed to penitence, and if our corruption were not opposed to the purity of God, there would be nothing in this painful to us. We suffer only in proportion as the vice which is natural to us resists supernatural grace. Our heart feels torn asunder between these opposed efforts. But it would be very unfair to impute this violence to God, who is drawing us on, instead of to the world, which is holding us back. It is as a child, which a mother tears from the arms of robbers, in the pain it suffers, should love the loving and legitimate violence of her who procures its liberty, and detest only the impetuous and tyrannical violence of those who detain it unjustly. The most cruel war which God can make with men in this life is to leave them without that war which He came to bring. "I came to send war,"<a id="FNanchor_186_190"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_186_190" class="fnanchor pginternal">[186]</a> He says, "and to teach them of this war. I came to bring fire and the sword."<a id="FNanchor_187_191"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_187_191" class="fnanchor pginternal">[187]</a> Before Him the world lived in this false peace.</p>

<p><i>External works.</i>—There is nothing so perilous as what pleases God and man. For those states, which please God and man, have one property which pleases God, and another which pleases men; as the greatness of Saint Teresa. What pleased God was her deep humility in the midst of her revelations; what pleased men was her light. And so we torment ourselves to imitate her discourses, thinking to imitate her conditions, and not so much to love what God loves, and to put ourselves in the state which God loves.<a id="Page_138" class="pageno" title="[Pg 138]"/></p>

<p>What use will memory be to me, if it can alike hurt and help me, and all depends upon the blessing of God, who gives only to things done for Him, according to His rules and in His ways, the manner being as important as the thing, and perhaps more; since God can bring forth good out of evil, and without God we bring forth evil out of good?</p>

So the righteous man takes for himself nothing of the world, nor the applause of the world, but only for his passions, which he uses as their master, saying to the one, "Go," and to another, "Come." <i>Sub te erit appetitus tuus.</i><a id="FNanchor_190_194"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_190_194" class="fnanchor pginternal">[190]</a> The passions thus subdued are virtues. Even God attributes to Himself avarice, jealousy, anger; and these are virtues as well as kindness, pity, constancy, which are also passions. We must employ them as slaves, and, leaving to them their food, prevent the soul from taking any of it. For, when the passions become masters, they are vices; and they give their nutriment to the soul, and the soul nourishes itself upon it, and is poisoned.</p>

<p>It is, in peculiar phraseology, wholly the body of Jesus Christ, but it cannot be said to be the whole body of Jesus Christ.<a id="FNanchor_191_195"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_191_195" class="fnanchor pginternal">[191]</a> The union of two things without change does not enable us to say that one becomes the other; the soul thus being united to the body, the fire to the timber, without change. But change is necessary to make the form of the one become the form of the other; thus the union of the Word to man. Because my body without my soul would not make the body of a man; therefore my soul united to any matter whatsoever will make my body. It does not distinguish the necessary condition from the sufficient condition; the union is necessary, but not sufficient. The left arm is not the right.</p>

<p>Saint Augustine has distinctly said that strength would be taken away from the righteous. But it is by chance that he said it; for it might have happened that the occasion of saying it did not present itself. But his principles make us see that when the occasion for it presented itself, it was impossible that he should not say it, or that he should say anything to the contrary. It is then rather that he was forced to say it, when the occasion presented itself, than that he said it, when the occasion presented itself, the one being of necessity, the other of chance. But the two are all that we can ask.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between disciples and true disciples.

<p>This is the result of the knowledge of God obtained without Jesus Christ; it is communion without a mediator with the God whom they have known without a mediator. Whereas those who have known God by a mediator know their own wretchedness.</p>

<p>The God of the Christians is a God who makes the soul feel that He is her only good, that her only rest is in Him, that her<a id="Page_146" class="pageno" title="[Pg 146]"/> only delight is in loving Him; and who makes her at the same time abhor the obstacles which keep her back, and prevent her from loving God with all her strength. Self-love and lust, which hinder us, are unbearable to her. Thus God makes her feel that she has this root of self-love which destroys her, and which He alone can cure.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00561"><a id="p_544"/>544</h4>
<p>Jesus Christ did nothing but teach men that they loved themselves, that they were slaves, blind, sick, wretched, and sinners; that He must deliver them, enlighten, bless, and heal them; that this would be effected by hating self, and by following Him through suffering and the death on the cross.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00562"><a id="p_545"/>545</h4>
<p>Without Jesus Christ man must be in vice and misery; with Jesus Christ man is free from vice and misery; in Him is all our virtue and all our happiness. Apart from Him there is but vice, misery, darkness, death, despair.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00563"><a id="p_546"/>546</h4>
<p>We know God only by Jesus Christ. Without this mediator all communion with God is taken away; through Jesus Christ we know God. All those who have claimed to know God, and to prove Him without Jesus Christ, have had only weak proofs. But in proof of Jesus Christ we have the prophecies, which are solid and palpable proofs. And these prophecies, being accomplished and proved true by the event, mark the certainty of these truths, and therefore the divinity of Christ. In Him then, and through Him, we know God. Apart from Him, and without the Scripture, without original sin, without a necessary Mediator promised and come, we cannot absolutely prove God, nor teach right doctrine and right morality. But through Jesus Christ, and in Jesus Christ, we prove God, and teach morality and doctrine. Jesus Christ is then the true God of men.</p>
<p>But we know at the same time our wretchedness; for this God is none other than the Saviour of our wretchedness. So we can only know God well by knowing our iniquities. Therefore those who have known God, without knowing their wretchedness, have not glorified Him, but have glorified themselves. <i>Quia ... non cognovit per sapientiam ... placuit Deo per stultitiam prædicationis salvos facere.</i><a id="Page_147" class="pageno" title="[Pg 147]"/><a id="FNanchor_201_205"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_201_205" class="fnanchor pginternal">[201]</a></p>

<p>Not only do we know God by Jesus Christ alone, but we know ourselves only by Jesus Christ. We know life and death only through Jesus Christ. Apart from Jesus Christ, we do not know what is our life, nor our death, nor God, nor ourselves.</p>

<p>These are my sentiments; and every day of my life I bless my Redeemer, who has implanted them in me, and who, of a man full of weakness, of miseries, of lust, of pride, and of ambition, has made a man free from all these evils by the power of His grace, to which all the glory of it is due, as of myself I have only misery and error.</p>

<p><i>The Mystery of Jesus.</i>—Jesus suffers in His passions the torments which men inflict upon Him; but in His agony He suffers the torments which He inflicts on Himself; <i>turbare semetipsum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_202_206"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_202_206" class="fnanchor pginternal">[202]</a> This is a suffering from no human, but an almighty hand, for He must be almighty to bear it.</p>
<p>Jesus seeks some comfort at least in His three dearest friends, and they are asleep. He prays them to bear with Him for a little, and they leave Him with entire indifference, having so little compassion that it could not prevent their sleeping even for a moment. And thus Jesus was left alone to the wrath of God.</p>
<p>Jesus is alone on the earth, without any one not only to feel and share His suffering, but even to know of it; He and Heaven were alone in that knowledge.</p>
<p>Jesus is in a garden, not of delight as the first Adam, where he lost himself and the whole human race, but in one of agony, where He saved Himself and the whole human race.</p>
<p>He suffers this affliction and this desertion in the horror of night.</p>
<p>I believe that Jesus never complained but on this single occasion; but then He complained as if he could no longer bear His extreme suffering. "My soul is sorrowful, even unto death."<a id="FNanchor_203_207"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_203_207" class="fnanchor pginternal">[203]</a></p>
<p>Jesus seeks companionship and comfort from men. This is the sole occasion in all His life, as it seems to me. But He receives it not, for His disciples are asleep.</p>
<p>Jesus will be in agony even to the end of the world. We must not sleep during that time.</p>
<p>Jesus, in the midst of this universal desertion, including that of His own friends chosen to watch with Him, finding them asleep, is vexed because of the danger to which they expose, not Him, but themselves; He cautions them for their own safety and their own good, with a sincere tenderness for them during their ingratitude, and warns them that the spirit is willing and the flesh weak.</p>
<p>Jesus, finding them still asleep, without being restrained by any consideration for themselves or for Him, has the kindness not to waken them, and leaves them in repose.<a id="Page_149" class="pageno" title="[Pg 149]"/></p>
<p>Jesus prays, uncertain of the will of His Father, and fears death; but, when He knows it, He goes forward to offer Himself to death. <i>Eamus. Processit</i><a id="FNanchor_204_208"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_204_208" class="fnanchor pginternal">[204]</a> (John).</p>
<p>Jesus asked of men and was not heard.</p>
<p>Jesus, while His disciples slept, wrought their salvation. He has wrought that of each of the righteous while they slept, both in their nothingness before their birth, and in their sins after their birth.</p>
<p>He prays only once that the cup pass away, and then with submission; and twice that it come if necessary.</p>
<p>Jesus is weary.</p>
<p>Jesus, seeing all His friends asleep and all His enemies wakeful, commits Himself entirely to His Father.</p>
<p>Jesus does not regard in Judas his enmity, but the order of God, which He loves and admits, since He calls him friend.</p>
<p>Jesus tears Himself away from His disciples to enter into His agony; we must tear ourselves away from our nearest and dearest to imitate Him.</p>
<p>Jesus being in agony and in the greatest affliction, let us pray longer.</p>
<p>We implore the mercy of God, not that He may leave us at peace in our vices, but that He may deliver us from them.</p>
<p>If God gave us masters by His own hand, oh! how necessary for us to obey them with a good heart! Necessity and events follow infallibly.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00573">THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION</h3>
<h4 id="pgepubid00574"><a id="p_555"/>555</h4>
<p>... Men blaspheme what they do not know. The Christian religion consists in two points. It is of equal concern to men to know them, and it is equally dangerous to be ignorant to them. And it is equally of God's mercy that He has given indications of both.</p>
<p>And yet they take occasion to conclude that one of these points does not exist, from that which should have caused them to infer the other. The sages who have said there is only one God have been persecuted, the Jews were hated, and still more the Christians. They have seen by the light of nature that if there be a true religion on earth, the course of all things must tend to it as to a centre.</p>
<p>The whole course of things must have for its object the establishment and the greatness of religion. Men must have within them feelings suited to what religion teaches us. And, finally, religion must so be the object and centre to which all things tend, that whoever knows the principles of religion can give an explanation both of the whole nature of man in particular, and of the whole course of the world in general.</p>
<p>And on this ground they take occasion to revile the Christian religion, because they misunderstand it. They imagine that it consists simply in the worship of a God considered as great, powerful, and eternal; which is strictly deism, almost as far removed from the Christian religion as atheism, which is its exact opposite. And thence they conclude that this religion is not true, because they do not see that all things concur to the establishment of this point, that God does not manifest Himself to men with all the evidence which He could show.</p>
<p>But let them conclude what they will against deism, they will conclude nothing against the Christian religion, which properly consists in the mystery of the Redeemer, who, uniting in Himself the two natures, human and divine, has redeemed men from the<a id="Page_153" class="pageno" title="[Pg 153]"/> corruption of sin in order to reconcile them in His divine person to God.</p>
<p>The Christian religion, then, teaches men these two truths; that there is a God whom men can know, and that there is a corruption in their nature which renders them unworthy of Him. It is equally important to men to know both these points; and it is equally dangerous for man to know God without knowing his own wretchedness, and to know his own wretchedness without knowing the Redeemer who can free him from it. The knowledge of only one of these points gives rise either to the pride of philosophers, who have known God, and not their own wretchedness, or to the despair of atheists, who know their own wretchedness, but not the Redeemer.</p>
<p>And, as it is alike necessary to man to know these two points, so is it alike merciful of God to have made us know them. The Christian religion does this; it is in this that it consists.</p>
<p>Let us herein examine the order of the world, and see if all things do not tend to establish these two chief points of this religion: Jesus Christ is the end of all, and the centre to which all tends. Whoever knows Him knows the reason of everything.</p>
<p>Those who fall into error err only through failure to see one of these two things. We can then have an excellent knowledge of God without that of our own wretchedness, and of our own wretchedness without that of God. But we cannot know Jesus Christ without knowing at the same time both God and our own wretchedness.</p>
<p>Therefore I shall not undertake here to prove by natural reasons either the existence of God, or the Trinity, or the immortality of the soul, or anything of that nature; not only because I should not feel myself sufficiently able to find in nature arguments to convince hardened atheists, but also because such knowledge without Jesus Christ is useless and barren. Though a man should be convinced that numerical proportions are immaterial truths, eternal and dependent on a first truth, in which they subsist, and which is called God, I should not think him far advanced towards his own salvation.</p>
<p>The God of Christians is not a God who is simply the author of mathematical truths, or of the order of the elements; that is the view of heathens and Epicureans. He is not merely a God who exercises His providence over the life and fortunes of men, to bestow on those who worship Him a long and happy life. That was the portion of the Jews. But the God of Abraham,<a id="Page_154" class="pageno" title="[Pg 154]"/> the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of Christians, is a God of love and of comfort, a God who fills the soul and heart of those whom He possesses, a God who makes them conscious of their inward wretchedness, and His infinite mercy, who unites Himself to their inmost soul, who fills it with humility and joy, with confidence and love, who renders them incapable of any other end than Himself.</p>
<p>All who seek God without Jesus Christ, and who rest in nature, either find no light to satisfy them, or come to form for themselves a means of knowing God and serving Him without a mediator. Thereby they fall either into atheism, or into deism, two things which the Christian religion abhors almost equally.</p>
<p>Without Jesus Christ the world would not exist; for it should needs be either that it would be destroyed or be a hell.</p>
<p>If the world existed to instruct man of God, His divinity would shine through every part in it in an indisputable manner; but as it exists only by Jesus Christ, and for Jesus Christ, and to teach men both their corruption and their redemption, all displays the proofs of these two truths.</p>
<p>All appearance indicates neither a total exclusion nor a manifest presence of divinity, but the presence of a God who hides Himself. Everything bears this character.</p>
<p>... Shall he alone who knows his nature know it only to be miserable? Shall he alone who knows it be alone unhappy?</p>
<p>... He must not see nothing at all, nor must he see sufficient for him to believe he possesses it; but he must see enough to know that he has lost it. For to know of his loss, he must see and not see; and that is exactly the state in which he naturally is.</p>
<p>... Whatever part he takes, I shall not leave him at rest ...</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00575"><a id="p_556"/>556</h4>
<p>... It is then true that everything teaches man his condition, but he must understand this well. For it is not true that all reveals God, and it is not true that all conceals God. But it is at the same time true that He hides Himself from those who tempt Him, and that He reveals Himself to those who seek Him, because men are both unworthy and capable of God; unworthy by their corruption capable by their original nature.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00576"><a id="p_557"/>557</h4>
<p>What shall we conclude from all our darkness, but our unworthiness?<a id="Page_155" class="pageno" title="[Pg 155]"/></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00577"><a id="p_558"/>558</h4>
<p>If there never had been any appearance of God, this eternal deprivation would have been equivocal, and might have as well corresponded with the absence of all divinity, as with the unworthiness of men to know Him; but His occasional, though not continual, appearances remove the ambiguity, If He appeared once, He exists always; and thus we cannot but conclude both that there is a God, and that men are unworthy of Him.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00578"><a id="p_559"/>559</h4>
<p>We do not understand the glorious state of Adam, nor the nature of his sin, nor the transmission of it to us. These are matters which took place under conditions of a nature altogether different from our own, and which transcend our present understanding.</p>
<p>The knowledge of all this is useless to us as a means of escape from it; and all that we are concerned to know, is that we are miserable, corrupt, separated from God, but ransomed by Jesus Christ, whereof we have wonderful proofs on earth.</p>
<p>So the two proofs of corruption and redemption are drawn from the ungodly, who live in indifference to religion, and from the Jews who are irreconcilable enemies.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00579"><a id="p_560"/>560</h4>
<p>There are two ways of proving the truths of our religion; one by the power of reason, the other by the authority of him who speaks.</p>
<p>We do not make use of the latter, but of the former. We do not say, "This must be believed, for Scripture, which says it, is divine." But we say that it must be believed for such and such a reason, which are feeble arguments, as reason may be bent to everything.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00580"><a id="p_561"/>561</h4>
<p>There is nothing on earth that does not show either the wretchedness of man, or the mercy of God; either the weakness of man without God, or the strength of man with God.</p>

<p>It will be one of the confusions of the damned to see that they are condemned by their own reason, by which they claimed to condemn the Christian religion.<a id="Page_156" class="pageno" title="[Pg 156]"/></p>

<p>The prophecies, the very miracles and proofs of our religion, are not of such a nature that they can be said to be absolutely convincing. But they are also of such a kind that it cannot be said that it is unreasonable to believe them. Thus there is both evidence and obscurity to enlighten some and confuse others. But the evidence is such that it surpasses, or at least equals, the evidence to the contrary; so that it is not reason which can determine men not to follow it, and thus it can only be lust or malice of heart. And by this means there is sufficient evidence to condemn, and insufficient to convince; so that it appears in those who follow it, that it is grace, and not reason, which makes them follow it; and in those who shun it, that it is lust, not reason, which makes them shun it.</p>

<p>The two contrary reasons. We must begin with that; without that we understand nothing, and all is heretical; and we must even add at the end of each truth that the opposite truth is to be remembered.</p>

<p><i>Objection.</i> The Scripture is plainly full of matters not dictated by the Holy Spirit.—<i>Answer.</i> Then they do not harm faith.—<i>Objection.</i> But the Church has decided that all is of the Holy Spirit.—<i>Answer.</i> I answer two things: first, the Church has not so decided; secondly, if she should so decide, it could be maintained.</p>
<p>Do you think that the prophecies cited in the Gospel are related to make you believe? No, it is to keep you from believing.<a id="Page_157" class="pageno" title="[Pg 157]"/></p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00588"><a id="p_569"/>569</h4>
<p>To the chapter on the <i>Fundamentals</i> must be added that on <i>Typology</i> touching the reason of types: why Jesus Christ was prophesied as to His first coming; why prophesied obscurely as to the manner.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00589"><a id="p_570"/>570</h4>
<p><i>The reason why. Types.</i>—[They had to deal with a carnal people and to render them the depositary of the spiritual covenant.] To give faith to the Messiah, it was necessary there should have been precedent prophecies, and that these should be conveyed by persons above suspicion, diligent, faithful, unusually zealous, and known to all the world.</p>
<p>To accomplish all this, God chose this carnal people, to whom He entrusted the prophecies which foretell the Messiah as a deliverer, and as a dispenser of those carnal goods which this people loved. And thus they have had an extraordinary passion for their prophets, and, in sight of the whole world, have had charge of these books which foretell their Messiah, assuring all nations that He should come, and in the way foretold in the books, which they held open to the whole world. Yet this people, deceived by the poor and ignominious advent of the Messiah, have been His most cruel enemies. So that they, the people least open to suspicion in the world of favouring us, the most strict and most zealous that can be named for their law and their prophets, have kept the books incorrupt. Hence those who have rejected and crucified Jesus Christ, who has been to them an offence, are those who have charge of the books which testify of Him, and state that He will be an offence and rejected. Therefore they have shown it was He by rejecting Him, and He has been alike proved both by the righteous Jews who received Him, and by the unrighteous who rejected Him, both facts having been foretold.</p>
<p>Wherefore the prophecies have a hidden and spiritual meaning, to which this people were hostile, under the carnal meaning which they loved. If the spiritual meaning had been revealed, they would not have loved it, and, unable to bear it, they would not have been zealous of the preservation of their books and their<a id="Page_158" class="pageno" title="[Pg 158]"/> ceremonies; and if they had loved these spiritual promises, and had preserved them incorrupt till the time of the Messiah, their testimony would have had no force, because they had been his friends.</p>
<p>Therefore it was well that the spiritual meaning should be concealed; but, on the other hand, if this meaning had been so hidden as not to appear at all, it could not have served as a proof of the Messiah. What then was done? In a crowd of passages it has been hidden under the temporal meaning, and in a few has been clearly revealed; besides that the time and the state of the world have been so clearly foretold that it is clearer than the sun. And in some places this spiritual meaning is so clearly expressed, that it would require a blindness like that which the flesh imposes on the spirit when it is subdued by it, not to recognise it.</p>
<p>See, then, what has been the prudence of God. This meaning is concealed under another in an infinite number of passages, and in some, though rarely, it is revealed; but yet so that the passages in which it is concealed are equivocal, and can suit both meanings; whereas the passages where it is disclosed are unequivocal, and can only suit the spiritual meaning.</p>
<p>So that this cannot lead us into error, and could only be misunderstood by so carnal a people.</p>
<p>For when blessings are promised in abundance, what was to prevent them from understanding the true blessings, but their covetousness, which limited the meaning to worldly goods? But those whose only good was in God referred them to God alone. For there are two principles, which divide the wills of men, covetousness and charity. Not that covetousness cannot exist along with faith in God, nor charity with worldly riches; but covetousness uses God, and enjoys the world, and charity is the opposite.</p>
<p>Now the ultimate end gives names to things. All which prevents us from attaining it, is called an enemy to us. Thus the creatures, however good, are the enemies of the righteous, when they turn them away from God, and God Himself is the enemy of those whose covetousness He confounds.</p>
<p>Thus as the significance of the word "enemy" is dependent on the ultimate end, the righteous understood by it their passions, and the carnal the Babylonians; and so these terms were obscure only for the unrighteous. And this is what Isaiah says: <i>Signa legem in electis meis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_208_212"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_208_212" class="fnanchor pginternal">[208]</a> and that Jesus Christ shall be a stone of<a id="Page_159" class="pageno" title="[Pg 159]"/> stumbling. But, "Blessed are they who shall not be offended in him." Hosea,<a id="FNanchor_209_213"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_209_213" class="fnanchor pginternal">[209]</a> <i>ult.</i>, says excellently, "Where is the wise? and he shall understand what I say. The righteous shall know them, for the ways of God are right; but the transgressors shall fall therein."</p>
