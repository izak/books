<p><i>Blindness of Scripture.</i>—"The Scripture," said the Jews, "says that we shall not know whence Christ will come (John vii, 27, and xii, 34). The Scripture says that Christ abideth for ever, and He said that He should die." Therefore, says Saint John,<a id="FNanchor_210_214"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_210_214" class="fnanchor pginternal">[210]</a> they believed not, though He had done so many miracles, that the word of Isaiah might be fulfilled: "He hath blinded them," etc.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00592"><a id="p_573"/>573</h4>
<p><i>Greatness.</i>—Religion is so great a thing that it is right that those who will not take the trouble to seek it, if it be obscure, should be deprived of it. Why, then, do any complain, if it be such as can be found by seeking?</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00593"><a id="p_574"/>574</h4>
<p>All things work together for good to the elect, even the obscurities of Scripture; for they honour them because of what is divinely clear. And all things work together for evil to the rest of the world, even what is clear; for they revile such, because of the obscurities which they do not understand.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00594"><a id="p_575"/>575</h4>
<p><i>The general conduct of the world towards the Church: God willing to blind and to enlighten.</i>—The event having proved the divinity of these prophecies, the rest ought to be believed. And thereby we see the order of the world to be of this kind. The miracles of the Creation and the Deluge being forgotten, God sends the law and the miracles of Moses, the prophets who prophesied particular things; and to prepare a lasting miracle,<a id="Page_160" class="pageno" title="[Pg 160]"/> He prepares prophecies and their fulfilment; but, as the prophecies could be suspected, He desires to make them above suspicion, etc.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00595"><a id="p_576"/>576</h4>
<p>God has made the blindness of this people subservient to the good of the elect.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00596"><a id="p_577"/>577</h4>
<p>There is sufficient clearness to enlighten the elect, and sufficient obscurity to humble them. There is sufficient obscurity to blind the reprobate, and sufficient clearness to condemn them, and make them inexcusable.—Saint Augustine, Montaigne, Sébond.</p>
<p>The genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament is intermingled with so many others that are useless, that it cannot be distinguished. If Moses had kept only the record of the ancestors of Christ, that might have been too plain. If he had not noted that of Jesus Christ, it might not have been sufficiently plain. But, after all, whoever looks closely sees that of Jesus Christ expressly traced through Tamar,<a id="FNanchor_211_215"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_211_215" class="fnanchor pginternal">[211]</a> Ruth,<a id="FNanchor_212_216"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_212_216" class="fnanchor pginternal">[212]</a> etc.</p>
<p>Those who ordained these sacrifices, knew their uselessness; those who have declared their uselessness, have not ceased to practise them.</p>
<p>If God had permitted only one religion, it had been too easily known; but when we look at it closely, we clearly discern the truth amidst this confusion.</p>
<p><i>The premiss.</i>—Moses was a clever man. If, then, he ruled himself by his reason, he would say nothing clearly which was directly against reason.</p>
<p>Thus all the very apparent weaknesses are strength. Example; the two genealogies in Saint Matthew and Saint Luke. What can be clearer than that this was not concerted?</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00597"><a id="p_578"/>578</h4>
<p>God (and the Apostles), foreseeing that the seeds of pride would make heresies spring up, and being unwilling to give them occasion to arise from correct expressions, has put in Scripture and the prayers of the Church contrary words and sentences to produce their fruit in time.</p>
<p>So in morals He gives charity, which produces fruits contrary to lust.<a id="Page_161" class="pageno" title="[Pg 161]"/></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00598"><a id="p_579"/>579</h4>
<p>Nature has some perfections to show that she is the image of God, and some defects to show that she is only His image.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00599"><a id="p_580"/>580</h4>
<p>God prefers rather to incline the will than the intellect. Perfect clearness would be of use to the intellect, and would harm the will. To humble pride.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00600"><a id="p_581"/>581</h4>
<p>We make an idol of truth itself; for truth apart from charity is not God, but His image and idol, which we must neither love nor worship; and still less must we love or worship its opposite, namely, falsehood.</p>
<p>I can easily love total darkness; but if God keeps me in a state of semi-darkness, such partial darkness displeases me, and, because I do not see therein the advantage of total darkness, it is unpleasant to me. This is a fault, and a sign that I make for myself an idol of darkness, apart from the order of God. Now only His order must be worshipped.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00601"><a id="p_582"/>582</h4>
<p>The feeble-minded are people who know the truth, but only affirm it so far as consistent with their own interest. But, apart from that, they renounce it.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00602"><a id="p_583"/>583</h4>
<p>The world exists for the exercise of mercy and judgment, not as if men were placed in it out of the hands of God, but as hostile to God; and to them He grants by grace sufficient light, that they may return to Him, if they desire to seek and follow Him; and also that they may be punished, if they refuse to seek or follow Him.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00603"><a id="p_584"/>584</h4>
<p><i>That God has willed to hide Himself.</i>—If there were only one religion, God would indeed be manifest. The same would be the case, if there were no martyrs but in our religion.</p>
<p>God being thus hidden, every religion which does not affirm that God is hidden, is not true; and every religion which does not give the reason of it, is not instructive. Our religion does, all this: <i>Vere tu es Deus absconditus.</i><a id="Page_162" class="pageno" title="[Pg 162]"/></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00604"><a id="p_585"/>585</h4>
<p>If there were no obscurity, man would not be sensible of his corruption; if there were no light, man would not hope for a remedy. Thus, it is not only fair, but advantageous to us, that God be partly hidden and partly revealed; since it is equally dangerous to man to know God without knowing his own wretchedness, and to know his own wretchedness without knowing God.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00605"><a id="p_586"/>586</h4>
<p>This religion, so great in miracles, saints, blameless Fathers, learned and great witnesses, martyrs, established kings as David, and Isaiah, a prince of the blood, and so great in science, after having displayed all her miracles and all her wisdom, rejects all this, and declares that she has neither wisdom nor signs, but only the cross and foolishness.</p>
<p>For those, who, by these signs and that wisdom, have deserved your belief, and who have proved to you their character, declare to you that nothing of all this can change you, and render you capable of knowing and loving God, but the power of the foolishness of the cross without wisdom and signs, and not the signs without this power. Thus our religion is foolish in respect to the effective cause, and wise in respect to the wisdom which prepares it.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00606"><a id="p_587"/>587</h4>
<p>Our religion is wise and foolish. Wise, because it is the most learned, and the most founded on miracles, prophecies, etc. Foolish, because it is not all this which makes us belong to it. This makes us indeed condemn those who do not belong to it; but it does not cause belief in those who do belong to it. It is the cross that makes them believe, <i>ne evacuata sit crux</i>. And so Saint Paul, who came with wisdom and signs, says that he has come neither with wisdom nor with signs; for he came to convert. But those who come only to convince, can say that they come with wisdom and with signs.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00609"><a id="p_588"/>588</h4>
<p><i>On the fact that the Christian religion is not the only religion.</i>—So far is this from being a reason for believing that it is not the true one, that, on the contrary, it makes us see that it is so.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00610"><a id="p_589"/>589</h4>
<p>Men must be sincere in all religions; true heathens, true Jews, true Christians.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00612"><a id="p_591"/>591</h4>
<p><i>The falseness of other religions.</i>—They have no witnesses. Jews have. God defies other religions to produce such signs: Isaiah xliii, 9; xliv, 8.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00613"><a id="p_592"/>592</h4>
<p><i>History of China.</i><a id="FNanchor_213_217"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_213_217" class="fnanchor pginternal">[213]</a>-I believe only the histories, whose witnesses got themselves killed.</p>
<p>[Which is the more credible of the two, Moses or China?]</p>
<p>It is not a question of seeing this summarily. I tell you there is in it something to blind, and something to enlighten.</p>
<p>By this one word I destroy all your reasoning. "But China obscures," say you; and I answer, "China obscures, but there is clearness to be found; seek it."</p>
<p>Thus all that you say makes for one of the views, and not at all against the other. So this serves, and does no harm.</p>
<p>We must then see this in detail; we must put the papers on the table.<a id="Page_164" class="pageno" title="[Pg 164]"/></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00614"><a id="p_593"/>593</h4>
<p><i>Against the history of China.</i> The historians of Mexico, the five suns,<a id="FNanchor_214_218"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_214_218" class="fnanchor pginternal">[214]</a> of which the last is only eight hundred years old.</p>
<p>The difference between a book accepted by a nation, and one which makes a nation.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00615"><a id="p_594"/>594</h4>
<p>Mahomet was without authority. His reasons then should have been very strong, having only their own force. What does he say then, that we must believe him?</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00616"><a id="p_595"/>595</h4>
<p>The Psalms are chanted throughout the whole world.</p>
<p>Who renders testimony to Mahomet? Himself. Jesus Christ<a id="FNanchor_215_219"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_215_219" class="fnanchor pginternal">[215]</a> desires His own testimony to be as nothing.</p>
<p>The quality of witnesses necessitates their existence always and everywhere; and he, miserable creature, is alone.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00617"><a id="p_596"/>596</h4>
<p><i>Against Mahomet.</i>—The Koran is not more of Mahomet than the Gospel is of Saint Matthew, for it is cited by many authors from age to age. Even its very enemies, Celsus and Porphyry, never denied it.</p>
<p>The Koran says Saint Matthew was an honest man.<a id="FNanchor_216_220"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_216_220" class="fnanchor pginternal">[216]</a> Therefore Mahomet was a false prophet for calling honest men wicked, or for not agreeing with what they have said of Jesus Christ.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00618"><a id="p_597"/>597</h4>
<p>It is not by that which is obscure in Mahomet, and which may be interpreted in a mysterious sense, that I would have him judged, but by what is clear, as his paradise and the rest. In that he is ridiculous. And since what is clear is ridiculous, it is not right to take his obscurities for mysteries.</p>
<p>It is not the same with the Scripture. I agree that there are in it obscurities as strange as those of Mahomet; but there are admirably clear passages, and the prophecies are manifestly fulfilled. The cases are therefore not on a par. We must not confound, and put on one level things which only resemble each other in their obscurity, and not in the clearness, which requires us to reverence the obscurities.<a id="Page_165" class="pageno" title="[Pg 165]"/></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00619"><a id="p_598"/>598</h4>
<p><i>The difference between Jesus Christ and Mahomet.</i>—Mahomet was not foretold; Jesus Christ was foretold.</p>
<p>Mahomet slew; Jesus Christ caused His own to be slain.</p>
<p>Mahomet forbade reading; the Apostles ordered reading.</p>
<p>In fact the two are so opposed, that if Mahomet took the way to succeed from a worldly point of view, Jesus Christ, from the same point of view, took the way to perish. And instead of concluding that, since Mahomet succeeded, Jesus Christ might well have succeeded, we ought to say that since Mahomet succeeded, Jesus Christ should have failed.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00620"><a id="p_599"/>599</h4>
<p>Any man can do what Mahomet has done; for he performed no miracles, he was not foretold. No man can do what Christ has done.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00621"><a id="p_600"/>600</h4>
<p>The heathen religion has no foundation [at the present day. It is said once to have had a foundation by the oracles which spoke. But what are the books which assure us of this? Are they so worthy of belief on account of the virtue of their authors? Have they been preserved with such care that we can be sure that they have not been meddled with?]</p>
<p>The Mahometan religion has for a foundation the Koran and Mahomet. But has this prophet, who was to be the last hope of the world, been foretold? What sign has he that every other man has not, who chooses to call himself a prophet? What miracles does he himself say that he has done? What mysteries has he taught, even according to his own tradition? What was the morality, what the happiness held out by him?</p>
<p>The Jewish religion must be differently regarded in the tradition of the Holy Bible, and in the tradition of the people. Its morality and happiness are absurd in the tradition of the people, but are admirable in that of the Holy Bible. (And all religion is the same; for the Christian religion is very different in the Holy Bible and in the casuists.) The foundation is admirable; it is the most ancient book in the world, and the most authentic; and whereas Mahomet, in order to make his own book continue in existence, forbade men to read it, Moses,<a id="FNanchor_217_221"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_217_221" class="fnanchor pginternal">[217]</a> for the same reason, ordered every one to read his.<a id="Page_166" class="pageno" title="[Pg 166]"/></p>
<p>Our religion is so divine that another divine religion has only been the foundation of it.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00622"><a id="p_601"/>601</h4>
<p><i>Order.</i>—To see what is clear and indisputable in the whole state of the Jews.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00623"><a id="p_602"/>602</h4>
<p>The Jewish religion is wholly divine in its authority, its duration, its perpetuity, its morality, its doctrine, and its effects.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00624"><a id="p_603"/>603</h4>
<p>The only science contrary to common sense and human nature is that alone which has always existed among men.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00625"><a id="p_604"/>604</h4>
<p>The only religion contrary to nature, to common sense, and to our pleasure, is that alone which has always existed.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00626"><a id="p_605"/>605</h4>
<p>No religion but our own has taught that man is born in sin. No sect of philosophers has said this. Therefore none have declared the truth.</p>
<p>No sect or religion has always existed on earth, but the Christian religion.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00627"><a id="p_606"/>606</h4>
<p>Whoever judges of the Jewish religion by its coarser forms will misunderstand it. It is to be seen in the Holy Bible, and in the tradition of the prophets, who have made it plain enough that they did not interpret the law according to the letter. So our religion is divine in the Gospel, in the Apostles, and in tradition; but it is absurd in those who tamper with it.</p>
<p>The Messiah, according to the carnal Jews, was to be a great temporal prince. Jesus Christ, according to carnal Christians,<a id="FNanchor_218_222"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_218_222" class="fnanchor pginternal">[218]</a> has come to dispense us from the love of God, and to give us sacraments which shall do everything without our help. Such is not the Christian religion, nor the Jewish. True Jews and true Christians have always expected a Messiah who should make them love God, and by that love triumph over their enemies.<a id="Page_167" class="pageno" title="[Pg 167]"/></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00628"><a id="p_607"/>607</h4>
<p>The carnal Jews hold a midway place between Christians and heathens. The heathens know not God, and love the world only. The Jews know the true God, and love the world only. The Christians know the true God, and love not the world. Jews and heathens love the same good. Jews and Christians know the same God.</p>
<p>The Jews were of two kinds; the first had only heathen affections, the other had Christian affections.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00629"><a id="p_608"/>608</h4>
<p>There are two kinds of men in each religion: among the heathen, worshippers of beasts, and the worshippers of the one only God of natural religion; among the Jews, the carnal, and the spiritual, who were the Christians of the old law; among Christians, the coarser-minded, who are the Jews of the new law. The carnal Jews looked for a carnal Messiah; the coarser Christians believe that the Messiah has dispensed them from the love of God; true Jews and true Christians worship a Messiah who makes them love God.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00630"><a id="p_609"/>609</h4>
<p><i>To show that the true Jews and the true Christians have but the same religion.</i>—The religion of the Jews seemed to consist essentially in the fatherhood of Abraham, in circumcision, in sacrifices, in ceremonies, in the Ark, in the temple, in Jerusalem, and, finally, in the law, and in the covenant with Moses.</p>
<p>I say that it consisted in none of those things, but only in the love of God, and that God disregarded all the other things.</p>
<p>That God did not accept the posterity of Abraham.</p>
<p>That the Jews were to be punished like strangers, if they transgressed. <i>Deut.</i> viii, 19; "If thou do at all forget the Lord thy God, and walk after other gods, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish, as the nations which the Lord destroyeth before your face."</p>
<p>That strangers, if they loved God, were to be received by Him as the Jews. <i>Isaiah</i> lvi, 3: "Let not the stranger say, 'The Lord will not receive me.' The strangers who join themselves unto the Lord to serve Him and love Him, will I bring unto my holy mountain, and accept therein sacrifices, for mine house is a house of prayer."<a id="Page_168" class="pageno" title="[Pg 168]"/></p>
<p>That the true Jews considered their merit to be from God only, and not from Abraham. <i>Isaiah</i> lxiii, 16; "Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not. Thou art our Father and our Redeemer."</p>
<p>Moses himself told them that God would not accept persons. <i>Deut.</i> x, 17: "God," said he, "regardeth neither persons nor sacrifices."</p>
<p>The Sabbath was only a sign, <i>Exod.</i> xxxi, 13; and in memory of the escape from Egypt, <i>Deut.</i> v, 19. Therefore it is no longer necessary, since Egypt must be forgotten.</p>
<p>Circumcision was only a sign, <i>Gen.</i> xvii, 11. And thence it came to pass that, being in the desert, they were not circumcised because they could not be confounded with other peoples; and after Jesus Christ came, it was no longer necessary.</p>
<p>That the circumcision of the heart is commanded. <i>Deut.</i> x, 16; <i>Jeremiah</i> iv, 4: "Be ye circumcised in heart; take away the superfluities of your heart, and harden yourselves not. For your God is a mighty God, strong and terrible, who accepteth not persons."</p>
<p>That God said He would one day do it. <i>Deut.</i> xxx, 6; "God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, that thou mayest love Him with all thine heart."</p>
<p>That the uncircumcised in heart shall be judged. <i>Jeremiah</i> ix, 26: For God will judge the uncircumcised peoples, and all the people of Israel, because he is "uncircumcised in heart."</p>
<p>That the external is of no avail apart from the internal. <i>Joel</i> ii, 13: <i>Scindite corda vestra</i>, etc.; <i>Isaiah</i> lviii, 3, 4, etc.</p>
<p>The love of God is enjoined in the whole of Deuteronomy. <i>Deut.</i> xxx, 19: "I call heaven and earth to record that I have set before you life and death, that you should choose life, and love God, and obey Him, for God is your life."</p>
<p>That the Jews, for lack of that love, should be rejected for their offences, and the heathen chosen in their stead. <i>Hosea</i> i, 10; <i>Deut.</i> xxxii, 20. "I will hide myself from them in view of their latter sins, for they are a froward generation without faith. They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God, and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people, and with an ignorant and foolish nation." <i>Isaiah</i> lxv, 1.</p>
<p>That temporal goods are false, and that the true good is to be united to God. <i>Psalm</i> cxliii, 15.</p>
<p>That their feasts are displeasing to God. <i>Amos</i> v, 21.<a id="Page_169" class="pageno" title="[Pg 169]"/></p>
<p>That the sacrifices of the Jews displeased God. <i>Isaiah</i> lxvi. 1-3; i, II; <i>Jer.</i> vi, 20; David, <i>Miserere.</i>—Even on the part of the good, <i>Expectavi</i>. <i>Psalm</i> xlix, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.</p>
<p>That He has established them only for their hardness. <i>Micah</i>, admirably, vi; 1 <i>Kings</i> xv, 22; <i>Hosea</i> vi, 6.</p>
<p>That the sacrifices of the Gentiles will be accepted of God, and that God will take no pleasure in the sacrifices of the Jews. <i>Malachi</i> i, II.</p>
<p>That God will make a new covenant with the Messiah, and the old will be annulled. <i>Jer.</i> xxxi, 31. <i>Mandata non bona. Ezek.</i></p>
<p>That the old things will be forgotten. <i>Isaiah</i> xliii, 18, 19; lxv 17, 10.</p>
<p>That the Ark will no longer be remembered. <i>Jer.</i> iii, 15, 16.</p>
<p>That the temple should be rejected. <i>Jer.</i> vii, 12, 13, 14.</p>
<p>That the sacrifices should be rejected, and other pure sacrifices established. <i>Malachi</i> i, II.</p>
<p>That the order of Aaron's priesthood should be rejected, and that of Melchizedek introduced by the Messiah. <i>Ps. Dixit Dominus.</i></p>
<p>That this priesthood should be eternal. <i>Ibid.</i></p>
<p>That Jerusalem should be rejected, and Rome admitted. <i>Ps. Dixit Dominus.</i></p>
<p>That the name of the Jews should be rejected, and a new name given. <i>Isaiah</i> lxv, 15.</p>
<p>That this last name should be more excellent than that of the Jews, and eternal. <i>Isaiah</i> lvi, 5.</p>
<p>That the Jews should be without prophets (Amos), without a king, without princes, without sacrifice, without an idol.</p>
<p>That the Jews should nevertheless always remain a people. <i>Jer.</i> xxxi, 36.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00631"><a id="p_610"/>610</h4>
<p><i>Republic.</i>—The Christian republic—and even the Jewish—has only had God for ruler, as Philo the Jew notices, <i>On Monarchy</i>.</p>
<p>When they fought, it was for God only; their chief hope was in God only; they considered their towns as belonging to God only, and kept them for God. 1 <i>Chron.</i> xix, 13.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00632"><a id="p_611"/>611</h4>
<p><i>Gen.</i> xvii, 7. <i>Statuam pactum meum inter me et te fœdere sempiterno ... ut sim Deus tuus ...</i></p>
<p><i>Et tu ergo custodies pactum meum.</i><a id="Page_170" class="pageno" title="[Pg 170]"/></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00633"><a id="p_612"/>612</h4>
<p><i>Perpetuity.</i>—That religion has always existed on earth, which consists in believing that man has fallen from a state of glory and of communion with God into a state of sorrow, penitence, and estrangement from God, but that after this life we shall be restored by a Messiah who should have come. All things have passed away, and this has endured, for which all things are.</p>
<p>Men have in the first age of the world been carried away into every kind of debauchery, and yet there were saints, as Enoch, Lamech, and others, who waited patiently for the Christ promised from the beginning of the world. Noah saw the wickedness of men at its height; and he was held worthy to save the world in his person, by the hope of the Messiah of whom he was the type. Abraham was surrounded by idolaters, when God made known to him the mystery of the Messiah, whom he welcomed from afar.<a id="FNanchor_219_223"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_219_223" class="fnanchor pginternal">[219]</a> In the time of Isaac and Jacob abomination was spread over all the earth; but these saints lived in faith; and Jacob, dying and blessing his children, cried in a transport which made him break off his discourse, "I await, O my God, the Saviour whom Thou hast promised. <i>Salutare taum expectabo, Domine.</i>"<a id="FNanchor_220_224"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_220_224" class="fnanchor pginternal">[220]</a> The Egyptians were infected both with idolatry and magic; the very people of God were led astray by their example. Yet Moses and others believed Him whom they saw not, and worshipped Him, looking to the eternal gifts which He was preparing for them.</p>
<p>The Greeks and Latins then set up false deities; the poets made a hundred different theologies, while the philosophers separated into a thousand different sects; and yet in the heart of Judæa there were always chosen men who foretold the coming of this Messiah, which was known to them alone.</p>
<p>He came at length in the fullness of time, and time has since witnessed the birth of so many schisms and heresies, so many political revolutions, so many changes in all things; yet this Church, which worships Him who has always been worshipped, has endured uninterruptedly. It is a wonderful, incomparable, and altogether divine fact that this religion, which has always endured, has always been attacked. It has been a thousand times on the eve of universal destruction, and every time it has been in that state, God has restored it by extraordinary acts of His power. This is astonishing, as also that it has preserved itself without yielding to the will of tyrants. For it is not strange that a State endures, when its laws are sometimes made<a id="Page_171" class="pageno" title="[Pg 171]"/> to give way to necessity, but that ... (See the passage indicated in Montaigne.)</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00634"><a id="p_613"/>613</h4>
<p>States would perish if they did not often make their laws give way to necessity. But religion has never suffered this, or practised it. Indeed, there must be these compromises, or miracles. It is not strange to be saved by yieldings, and this is not strictly self-preservation; besides, in the end they perish entirely. None has endured a thousand years. But the fact that this religion has always maintained itself, inflexible as it is, proves its divinity.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00635"><a id="p_614"/>614</h4>
<p>Whatever may be said, it must be admitted that the Christian religion has something astonishing in it. Some will say, "This is because you were born in it." Far from it; I stiffen myself against it for this very reason, for fear this prejudice bias me. But although I am born in it, I cannot help finding it so.</p>

<p><i>Perpetuity.</i>—The Messiah has always been believed in. The tradition from Adam was fresh in Noah and in Moses. Since then the prophets have foretold him, while at the same time foretelling other things, which, being from time to time fulfilled in the sight of men, showed the truth of their mission, and consequently that of their promises touching the Messiah. Jesus Christ performed miracles, and the Apostles also, who converted all the heathen; and all the prophecies being thereby fulfilled, the Messiah is for ever proved.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00637"><a id="p_616"/>616</h4>
<p><i>Perpetuity.</i>—Let us consider that since the beginning of the world the expectation of worship of the Messiah has existed uninterruptedly; that there have been found men, who said that God had revealed to them that a Redeemer was to be born, who should save His people; that Abraham came afterwards, saying that he had had a revelation that the Messiah was to spring from him by a son, whom he should have; that Jacob declared that, of his twelve sons, the Messiah would spring from Judah; that Moses and the prophets then came to declare the time and the manner of His coming; that they said their law was only temporary till that of the Messiah, that it should endure till<a id="Page_172" class="pageno" title="[Pg 172]"/> then, but that the other should last for ever; that thus either their law, or that of the Messiah, of which it was the promise, would be always upon the earth; that, in fact, it has always endured; that at last Jesus Christ came with all the circumstances foretold. This is wonderful.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00638"><a id="p_617"/>617</h4>
<p>This is positive fact. While all philosophers separate into different sects, there is found in one corner of the world the most ancient people in it, declaring that all the world is in error, that God has revealed to them the truth, that they will always exist on the earth. In fact, all other sects come to an end, this one still endures, and has done so for four thousand years.</p>
<p>They declare that they hold from their ancestors that man has fallen from communion with God, and is entirely estranged from God, but that He has promised to redeem them; that this doctrine shall always exist on the earth; that their law has a double signification; that during sixteen hundred years they have had people, whom they believed prophets, foretelling both the time and the manner; that four hundred years after they were scattered everywhere, because Jesus Christ was to be everywhere announced; that Jesus Christ came in the manner, and at the time foretold; that the Jews have since been scattered abroad under a curse, and nevertheless still exist.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00639"><a id="p_618"/>618</h4>
<p>I see the Christian religion founded upon a preceding religion, and this is what I find as a fact.</p>
<p>I do not here speak of the miracles of Moses, of Jesus Christ, and of the Apostles, because they do not at first seem convincing, and because I only wish here to put in evidence all those foundations of the Christian religion which are beyond doubt, and which cannot be called in question by any person whatsoever. It is certain that we see in many places of the world a peculiar people, separated from all other peoples of the world, and called the Jewish people.</p>
<p>I see then a crowd of religions in many parts of the world and in all times; but their morality cannot please me, nor can their proofs convince me. Thus I should equally have rejected the religion of Mahomet and of China, of the ancient Romans and of the Egyptians, for the sole reason, that none having more<a id="Page_173" class="pageno" title="[Pg 173]"/> marks of truth than another, nor anything which should necessarily persuade me, reason cannot incline to one rather than the other.</p>
<p>But, in thus considering this changeable and singular variety of morals and beliefs at different times, I find in one corner of the world a peculiar people, separated from all other peoples on earth, the most ancient of all, and whose histories are earlier by many generations than the most ancient which we possess.</p>
<p>I find, then, this great and numerous people, sprung from a single man, who worship one God, and guide themselves by a law which they say that they obtained from His own hand. They maintain that they are the only people in the world to whom God has revealed His mysteries; that all men are corrupt and in disgrace with God; that they are all abandoned to their senses and their own imagination, whence come the strange errors and continual changes which happen among them, both of religions and of morals, whereas they themselves remain firm in their conduct; but that God will not leave other nations in this darkness for ever; that there will come a Saviour for all; that they are in the world to announce Him to men; that they are expressly formed to be forerunners and heralds of this great event, and to summon all nations to join with them in the expectation of this Saviour.</p>
<p>To meet with this people is astonishing to me, and seems to me worthy of attention. I look at the law which they boast of having obtained from God, and I find it admirable. It is the first law of all, and is of such a kind that, even before the term <i>law</i> was in currency among the Greeks, it had, for nearly a thousand years earlier, been uninterruptedly accepted and observed by the Jews. I likewise think it strange that the first law of the world happens to be the most perfect; so that the greatest legislators have borrowed their laws from it, as is apparent from the law of the Twelve Tables at Athens,<a id="FNanchor_221_225"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_221_225" class="fnanchor pginternal">[221]</a> afterwards taken by the Romans, and as it would be easy to prove, if Josephus<a id="FNanchor_222_226"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_222_226" class="fnanchor pginternal">[222]</a> and others had not sufficiently dealt with this subject.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00640"><a id="p_619"/>619</h4>
<p><i>Advantages of the Jewish people.</i>—In this search the Jewish people at once attracts my attention by the number of wonderful and singular facts which appear about them.</p>
<p>I first see that they are a people wholly composed of brethren,<a id="Page_174" class="pageno" title="[Pg 174]"/> and whereas all others are formed by the assemblage of an infinity of families, this, though so wonderfully fruitful, has all sprung from one man alone, and, being thus all one flesh, and members one of another, they constitute a powerful state of one family. This is unique.</p>
<p>This family, or people, is the most ancient within human knowledge, a fact which seems to me to inspire a peculiar veneration for it, especially in view of our present inquiry; since if God had from all time revealed Himself to men, it is to these we must turn for knowledge of the tradition.</p>
<p>This people is not eminent solely by their antiquity, but is also singular by their duration, which has always continued from their origin till now. For whereas the nations of Greece and of Italy, of Lacedæmon, of Athens and of Rome, and others who came long after, have long since perished, these ever remain, and in spite of the endeavours of many powerful kings who have a hundred times tried to destroy them, as their historians testify, and as it is easy to conjecture from the natural order of things during so long a space of years, they have nevertheless been preserved (and this preservation has been foretold); and extending from the earliest times to the latest, their history comprehends in its duration all our histories [which it preceded by a long time].</p>
<p>The law by which this people is governed is at once the most ancient law in the world, the most perfect, and the only one which has been always observed without a break in a state. This is what Josephus admirably proves, <i>against Apion</i>,<a id="FNanchor_223_227"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_223_227" class="fnanchor pginternal">[223]</a> and also Philo<a id="FNanchor_224_228"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_224_228" class="fnanchor pginternal">[224]</a> the Jew, in different places, where they point out that it is so ancient that the very name of <i>law</i> was only known by the oldest nation more than a thousand years afterwards; so that Homer, who has written the history of so many states, has never used the term. And it is easy to judge of its perfection by simply reading it; for we see that it has provided for all things with so great wisdom, equity, and judgment, that the most ancient legislators, Greek and Roman, having had some knowledge of it, have borrowed from it their principal laws; this is evident from what are called the Twelve Tables, and from the other proofs which Josephus gives.</p>
<p>But this law is at the same time the severest and strictest of all in respect to their religious worship, imposing on this people, in order to keep them to their duty, a thousand peculiar and painful observances, on pain of death. Whence it is very<a id="Page_175" class="pageno" title="[Pg 175]"/> astonishing that it has been constantly preserved during many centuries by a people, rebellious and impatient as this one was; while all other states have changed their laws from time to time, although these were far more lenient.</p>
<p>The book which contains this law, the first of all, is itself the most ancient book in the world, those of Homer, Hesiod, and others, being six or seven hundred years later.</p>

<p>The creation and the deluge being past, and God no longer requiring to destroy the world, nor to create it anew, nor to give such great signs of Himself, He began to establish a people on the earth, purposely formed, who were to last until the coming of the people whom the Messiah should fashion by His spirit.</p>

<p>The creation of the world beginning to be distant, God provided a single contemporary historian, and appointed a whole people as guardians of this book, in order that this history might be the most authentic in the world, and that all men might thereby learn a fact so necessary to know, and which could only be known through that means.</p>

<p>Why should Moses make the lives of men so long, and their generations so few?</p>
<p>Because it is not the length of years, but the multitude of generations, which renders things obscure. For truth is perverted only by the change of men.

<p>The longevity of the patriarchs, instead of causing the loss of past history, conduced, on the contrary, to its preservation. For the reason why we are sometimes insufficiently instructed in the history of our ancestors, is that we have never lived long with them, and that they are often dead before we have attained the age of reason. Now, when men lived so long, children lived long with their parents. They conversed long with them. But what else could be the subject of their talk save the history of their ancestors, since to that all history was reduced, and men did not study science or art, which now form a large part of daily conversation? We see also that in these days tribes took particular care to preserve their genealogies.</p>

<p><i>Antiquity of the Jews.</i>—What a difference there is between one book and another! I am not astonished that the Greeks made the Iliad, nor the Egyptians and the Chinese their histories.</p>
<p>We have only to see how this originates. These fabulous historians are not contemporaneous with the facts about which they write. Homer composes a romance, which he gives out as such, and which is received as such; for nobody doubted that Troy and Agamemnon no more existed than did the golden apple. Accordingly he did not think of making a history, but solely a book to amuse; he is the only writer of his time; the beauty of the work has made it last, every one learns it and talks of it, it is necessary to know it, and each one knows it by heart. Four hundred years afterwards the witnesses of these facts are no longer alive, no one knows of his own knowledge if it be a fable or a history; one has only learnt it from his ancestors, and this can pass for truth.</p>
<p>Every history which is not contemporaneous, as the books of the Sibyls and Trismegistus,<a id="FNanchor_226_230"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_226_230" class="fnanchor pginternal">[226]</a> and so many others which have been believed by the world, are false, and found to be false in the course of time. It is not so with contemporaneous writers.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between a book which an individual writes, and publishes to a nation, and a book which itself creates a nation. We cannot doubt that the book is as old as the people.<a id="Page_177" class="pageno" title="[Pg 177]"/></p>

The Jews held their property in<a id="Page_179" class="pageno" title="[Pg 179]"/> peace under Cyrus in Babylon; hence they could well have the Law.</p>

The Red Sea an image of the Redemption. <i>Ut sciatis quod filius hominis habet potestatem remittendi peccata, tibi dico: Surge.</i><a id="FNanchor_235_239"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_235_239" class="fnanchor pginternal">[235]</a> God, wishing to show that He could form a people holy with an invisible holiness, and fill them with an eternal glory, made visible things. As nature is an image of<a id="Page_182" class="pageno" title="[Pg 182]"/> grace, He has done in the bounties of nature what He would do in those of grace, in order that we might judge that He could make the invisible, since He made the visible excellently.</p>
<p>Therefore He saved this people from the deluge; He has raised them up from Abraham, redeemed them from their enemies, and set them at rest.</p>
<p>The object of God was not to save them from the deluge, and raise up a whole people from Abraham, only in order to bring them into a rich land.</p>
<p>And even grace is only the type of glory, for it is not the ultimate end. It has been symbolised by the law, and itself symbolises [<i>glory</i>]. But it is the type of it, and the origin or cause.</p>
<p>The ordinary life of men is like that of the saints. They all seek their satisfaction, and differ only in the object in which they place it; they call those their enemies who hinder them, etc. God has then shown the power which He has of giving invisible blessings, by that which He has shown Himself to have over things visible.</p>

<p><i>Types.</i>—God, wishing to form for Himself an holy people, whom He should separate from all other nations, whom He should deliver from their enemies, and should put into a place of rest, has promised to do so, and has foretold by His prophets the time and the manner of His coming. And yet, to confirm the hope of His elect, He has made them see in it an image through all time, without leaving them devoid of assurances of His power and of His will to save them. For, at the creation of man, Adam was the witness, and guardian of the promise of a Saviour, who should be born of woman, when men were still so near the creation that they could not have forgotten their creation and their fall. When those who had seen Adam were no longer in the world, God sent Noah whom He saved, and drowned the whole earth by a miracle which sufficiently indicated the power which He had to save the world, and the will which He had to do so, and to raise up from the seed of woman Him whom He had promised. This miracle was enough to confirm the hope of men.</p>
<p>The memory of the deluge being so fresh among men, while Noah was still alive, God made promises to Abraham, and, while Shem was still living, sent Moses, etc....<a id="Page_183" class="pageno" title="[Pg 183]"/></p>

<p>The Synagogue did not perish, because it was a type. But because it was only a type, it fell into servitude. The type existed till the truth came, in order that the Church should be always visible, either in the sign which promised it, or in substance.</p>

<p>That the law was figurative.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00670"><a id="p_647"/>647</h4>
<p>Two errors: 1. To take everything literally. 2. To take everything spiritually.</p>

<p>There are some types clear and demonstrative, but others which seem somewhat far-fetched, and which convince only those who are already persuaded. These are like the Apocalyptics. But the difference is that they have none which are certain, so that nothing is so unjust as to claim that theirs are as well founded as some of ours; for they have none so demonstrative as some of ours. The comparison is unfair. We must not put on the same level, and confound things, because they seem to agree in one point, while they are so different in another. The clearness in divine things requires us to revere the obscurities in them.</p>
<p>[It is like men, who employ a certain obscure language among themselves. Those who should not understand it, would understand only a foolish meaning.]</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00673"><a id="p_650"/>650</h4>
<p><i>Extravagances of the Apocalyptics, Preadamites, Millenarians, etc.</i>—He who would base extravagant opinions on Scripture, will, for example, base them on this. It is said that "this generation<a id="Page_184" class="pageno" title="[Pg 184]"/> shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled."<a id="FNanchor_236_240"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_236_240" class="fnanchor pginternal">[236]</a> Upon that I will say that after that generation will come another generation, and so on ever in succession.</p>

<p>In God the word does not differ from the intention, for He is true; nor the word from the effect, for He is powerful; nor the means from the effect, for He is wise. Bern., <i>Ult. Sermo in Missam</i>.</p>
<p>Augustine, <i>De Civit. Dei</i>, v, 10. This rule is general. God can do everything, except those things, which if He could do, He would not be almighty, as dying, being deceived, lying, etc.</p>
<p>Several Evangelists for the confirmation of the truth; their difference useful.</p>

<p>The symbols of the Gospel for the state of the sick soul are sick bodies; but because one body cannot be sick enough to express it well, several have been needed. Thus there are the deaf, the dumb, the blind, the paralytic, the dead Lazarus, the possessed. All this crowd is in the sick soul.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00681"><a id="p_658"/>658</h4>
<p><i>Types.</i>—To show that the Old Testament is only figurative, and that the prophets understood by temporal blessings other blessings, this is the proof:</p>
<p>First, that this would be unworthy of God.</p>
<p>Secondly, that their discourses express very clearly the promise of temporal blessings, and that they say nevertheless that their discourses are obscure, and that their meaning will not be understood. Whence it appears that this secret meaning was not that which they openly expressed, and that consequently they meant to speak of other sacrifices, of another deliverer, etc. They say that they will be understood only in the fullness of time (Jer. xxx, <i>ult.</i>).</p>
<p>The third proof is that their discourses are contradictory, and neutralise each other; so that if we think that they did not mean by the words "law" and "sacrifice" anything else than that of Moses, there is a plain and gross contradiction. Therefore they meant something else, sometimes contradicting themselves in the same chapter. Now, to understand the meaning of an author ...</p>

<p>The carnal Jews understood neither the greatness nor the humiliation of the Messiah foretold in their prophecies. They misunderstood Him in His foretold greatness, as when He said that the Messiah should be lord of David, though his son, and that He was before Abraham, who had seen Him. They did not believe Him so great as to be eternal, and they likewise misunderstood Him in His humiliation and in His death. "The Messiah," said they, "abideth for ever, and this man says that he shall die."<a id="FNanchor_240_244"/><a href="18269-h-11.html#Footnote_240_244" class="fnanchor pginternal">[240]</a> Therefore they believed Him neither mortal nor eternal; they only sought in Him for a carnal greatness.</p>

<p><i>Typical.</i>—Nothing is so like charity as covetousness, and nothing is so opposed to it. Thus the Jews, full of possessions which flattered their covetousness, were very like Christians, and very contrary. And by this means they had the two qualities which it was necessary they should have, to be very like the Messiah to typify Him, and very contrary not to be suspected witnesses.</p>

<p>Charity is not a figurative precept. It is dreadful to say that Jesus Christ, who came to take away types in order to establish the truth, came only to establish the type of charity, in order to take away the existing reality which was there before.</p>
