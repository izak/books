<body><p>"Thus saith the Lord: What is the bill of this divorcement, wherewith I have put away the synagogue? and why have I delivered it into the hands of your enemies? Is it not for your iniquities and for your transgressions that I have put it away?</p>
<p>"For I came, and no man received me; I called and there was none to hear. Is my arm shortened, that I cannot redeem?</p>
<p>"Therefore I will show the tokens of mine anger; I will clothe the heavens with darkness, and make sackcloth their covering.</p>
<p>"The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary. He hath opened mine ear, and I have listened to Him as a master.</p>
<p>"The Lord hath revealed His will, and I was not rebellious.</p>
<p>"I gave my body to the smiters, and my cheeks to outrage; I hid not my face from shame and spitting. But the Lord hath helped me; therefore I have not been confounded.</p>
<p>"He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? who will be mine adversary, and accuse me of sin, God himself being my protector?<a id="Page_217" class="pageno" title="[Pg 217]"/></p>
<p>"All men shall pass away, and be consumed by time; let those that fear God hearken to the voice of His servant; let him that languisheth in darkness put his trust in the Lord. But as for you, ye do but kindle the wrath of God upon you; ye walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.</p>
<p>"Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged. Look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, when childless, and increased him. Behold, I have comforted Zion, and heaped upon her blessings and consolations.</p>
<p>"Hearken unto me, my people, and give ear unto me: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the Gentiles."</p>
<p>Amos viii. The prophet, having enumerated the sins of Israel, said that God had sworn to take vengeance on them.</p>
<p>He says this: "And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day; and I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation.</p>
<p>"You all shall have sorrow and suffering, and I will make this nation mourn as for an only son, and the end therefore as a bitter day. Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.</p>
<p>"In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst. They that have followed the idols of Samaria, and sworn by the god of Dan, and followed the manner of Beersheba, shall fall, and never rise up again."</p>
<p>Amos iii, 2: "Ye only have I known of all the families of the earth for my people."</p>
<p>Daniel xii, 7. Having described all the extent of the reign of the Messiah, he says: "All these things shall be finished, when the scattering of the people of Israel shall be accomplished."</p>
<p>Haggai ii, 4: "Ye who, comparing this second house with the glory of the first, despise it, be strong, saith the Lord, be strong, O Zerubbabel, and O Jesus, the high priest, be strong, all ye<a id="Page_218" class="pageno" title="[Pg 218]"/> people of the land, and work. For I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts; according to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you. Fear ye not. For thus saith the Lord of hosts: Yet one little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land," (a way of speaking to indicate a great and an extraordinary change); "and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all the Gentiles shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>"The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord," (that is to say, it is not by that that I wish to be honoured; as it is said elsewhere: All the beasts of the field are mine, what advantages me that they are offered me in sacrifice?). "The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts; and in this place will I establish my house, saith the Lord.</p>

I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he will speak in my name, I will require it of him."</p>
<p>Genesis xlix: "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise, and thou shalt conquer thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up, and art couched as a lion, and as a lioness that shall be roused up.</p>
<p>"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be."</p>

<p><i>During the life of the Messiah.</i>—<i>Ænigmatis.</i>—Ezek. xvii.</p>
<p>His forerunner. Malachi iii.</p>
<p>He will be born an infant. Is. ix.</p>
<p>He will be born in the village of Bethlehem. Micah v. He will appear chiefly in Jerusalem, and will be a descendant of the family of Judah and of David.</p>
<p>He is to blind the learned and the wise, Is. vi, viii, xxix, etc.;<a id="Page_219" class="pageno" title="[Pg 219]"/> and to preach the Gospel to the lowly, Is. xxix; to open the eyes of the blind, give health to the sick, and bring light to those that languish in darkness. Is. lxi.</p>
<p>He is to show the perfect way, and be the teacher of the Gentiles. Is. lv; xlii, 1-7.</p>
<p>The prophecies are to be unintelligible to the wicked, Dan. xii; Hosea xiv, 10; but they are to be intelligible to those who are well informed.</p>
<p>The prophecies, which represent Him as poor, represent Him as master of the nations. Is. lii, 14, etc.; liii; Zech. ix, 9.</p>
<p>The prophecies, which foretell the time, foretell Him only as master of the nations and suffering, and not as in the clouds nor as judge. And those, which represent Him thus as judge and in glory, do not mention the time. When the Messiah is spoken of as great and glorious, it is as the judge of the world, and not its Redeemer.</p>
<p>He is to be the victim for the sins of the world. Is. xxxix, liii, etc.</p>
<p>He is to be the precious corner-stone. Is. xxviii, 16.</p>
<p>He is to be a stone of stumbling and offence. Is. viii. Jerusalem is to dash against this stone.</p>
<p>The builders are to reject this stone. Ps. cxvii, 22.</p>
<p>God is to make this stone the chief corner-stone.</p>
<p>And this stone is to grow into a huge mountain, and fill the whole earth. Dan. ii.</p>
<p>So He is to be rejected, despised, betrayed (Ps. cviii, 8), sold (Zech. xi, 12), spit upon, buffeted, mocked, afflicted in innumerable ways, given gall to drink (Ps. lxviii), pierced (Zech. xii), His feet and His hands pierced, slain, and lots cast for His raiment.</p>
<p>He will raise again (Ps. xv) the third day (Hosea vi, 3).</p>
<p>He will ascend to heaven to sit on the right hand. Ps. cx.</p>
<p>The kings will arm themselves against Him. Ps. ii.</p>
<p>Being on the right hand of the Father, He will be victorious over His enemies.</p>
<p>The kings of the earth and all nations will worship Him. Is. lx.</p>
<p>The Jews will continue as a nation. Jeremiah.</p>
<p>They will wander, without kings, etc. (Hosea iii), without prophets (Amos), looking for salvation and finding it not (Isaiah).</p>
<p>Calling of the Gentiles by Jesus Christ. Is. lii, 15; lv, 5; lx, etc. Ps. lxxxi.</p>
<p>Hosea i, 9: "Ye are not my people, and I will not be your<a id="Page_220" class="pageno" title="[Pg 220]"/> God, when ye are multiplied after the dispersion. In the places where it was said, Ye are not my people, I will call them my people."</p>

<p>It was not lawful to sacrifice outside of Jerusalem, which was the place that the Lord had chosen, nor even to eat the tithes elsewhere. Deut. xii, 5, etc.; Deut. xiv, 23, etc.; xv, 20; xvi, 2, 7, 11, 15.</p>
<p>Hosea foretold that they should be without a king, without a prince, without a sacrifice, and without an idol; and this prophecy is now fulfilled, as they cannot make a lawful sacrifice out of Jerusalem.</p>

<p><i>Predictions.</i>—It was foretold that, in the time of the Messiah, He should come to establish a new covenant, which should make them forget the escape from Egypt (Jer. xxiii, 5; Is. xliii, 10); that He should place His law not in externals, but in the heart; that He should put His fear, which had only been from without, in the midst of the heart. Who does not see the Christian law in all this?</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00754"><a id="p_729"/>729</h4>
<p>... That then idolatry would be overthrown; that this Messiah would cast down all idols, and bring men into the worship of the true God.</p>
<p>That the temples of the idols would be cast down, and that among all nations, and in all places of the earth, He would be offered a pure sacrifice, not of beasts.</p>
<p>That He would be king of the Jews and Gentiles. And we see this king of the Jews and Gentiles oppressed by both, who conspire His death; and ruler of both, destroying the worship of Moses in Jerusalem, which was its centre, where He made His first Church; and also the worship of idols in Rome, the centre of it, where He made His chief Church.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00755"><a id="p_730"/>730</h4>
<p><i>Prophecies.</i>—That Jesus Christ will sit on the right hand, till God has subdued His enemies.</p>
<p>Therefore He will not subdue them Himself.</p>

<p>If I had in no wise heard of the Messiah, nevertheless, after such wonderful predictions of the course of the world which I see fulfilled, I see that He is divine. And if I knew that these same books foretold a Messiah, I should be sure that He would come; and seeing that they place His time before the destruction of the second temple, I should say that He had come.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00759"><a id="p_734"/>734</h4>
<p><i>Prophecies.</i>—That the Jews would reject Jesus Christ, and would be rejected of God, for this reason, that the chosen vine brought forth only wild grapes.

<p><i>Transfixerunt.</i> Zech. xii, 10.</p>
<p>That a deliverer should come, who would crush the demon's head, and free His people from their sins, <i>ex omnibus iniquitatibus</i>; that there should be a New Covenant, which would be eternal; that there should be another priesthood after the order of Melchisedek, and it should be eternal; that the Christ should be glorious, mighty, strong, and yet so poor that He would not be recognised, nor taken for what He is, but rejected and slain; that His people who denied Him should no longer be His people; that the idolaters should receive Him, and take refuge in Him; that He should leave Zion to reign in the centre of idolatry; that nevertheless the Jews should continue for ever; that He should be of Judah, and when there should be no longer a king.</p>

<p>... Therefore I reject all other religions. In that way I find an answer to all objections. It is right that a God so pure should only reveal Himself to those whose hearts are purified. Hence this religion is lovable to me, and I find it now sufficiently justified by so divine a morality. But I find more in it.</p>
<p>I find it convincing that, since the memory of man has lasted, it was constantly announced to men that they were universally corrupt, but that a Redeemer should come; that it was not one man who said it, but innumerable men, and a whole nation expressly made for the purpose, and prophesying for four thousand years. This is a nation which is more ancient than every other nation. Their books, scattered abroad, are four thousand years old.</p>
<p>The more I examine them, the more truths I find in them: an entire nation foretell Him before His advent, and an entire nation worship Him after His advent; what has preceded and what has followed; in short, people without idols and kings, this synagogue which was foretold, and these wretches who frequent it, and who, being our enemies, are admirable witnesses of the truth of these prophecies, wherein their wretchedness and even their blindness are foretold.</p>
<p>I find this succession, this religion, wholly divine in its authority, in its duration, in its perpetuity, in its morality, in its conduct, in its doctrine, in its effects. The frightful darkness of the Jews was foretold: <i>Eris palpans in meridie.<a id="FNanchor_276_280"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@18269@18269-h@18269-h-12.htm.html#Footnote_276_280" class="fnanchor pginternal">[276]</a> Dabitur liber scienti literas, et dicet: Non possum legere.</i><a id="FNanchor_277_281"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@18269@18269-h@18269-h-12.htm.html#Footnote_277_281" class="fnanchor pginternal">[277]</a> While the sceptre was still in the hands of the first foreign usurper, there is the report of the coming of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>So I hold out my arms to my <i>Redeemer</i>, who, having been foretold for four thousand years, has come to suffer and to die for me on earth, at the time and under all the circumstances foretold. By His grace, I await death in peace, in the hope of<a id="Page_223" class="pageno" title="[Pg 223]"/> being eternally united to Him. Yet I live with joy, whether in the prosperity which it pleases Him to bestow upon me, or in the adversity which He sends for my good, and which He has taught me to bear by His example.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00764"><a id="p_737"/>737</h4>
<p>The prophecies having given different signs which should all happen at the advent of the Messiah, it was necessary that all these signs should occur at the same time. So it was necessary that the fourth monarchy should have come, when the seventy weeks of Daniel were ended; and that the sceptre should have then departed from Judah. And all this happened without any difficulty. Then it was necessary that the Messiah should come; and Jesus Christ then came, who was called the Messiah. And all this again was without difficulty. This indeed shows the truth of the prophecies.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00765"><a id="p_738"/>738</h4>
<p>The prophets foretold, and were not foretold. The saints again were foretold, but did not foretell. Jesus Christ both foretold and was foretold.</p>

<p>The two oldest books in the world are those of Moses and Job, the one a Jew and the other a Gentile.

<p><i>Et tu conversus confirma fratres tuos.</i> But before, <i>conversus Jesus respexit Petrum</i>.</p>
<p>Saint Peter asks permission to strike Malchus, and strikes before hearing the answer. Jesus Christ replies afterwards.</p>
<p>The word, <i>Galilee</i>, which the Jewish mob pronounced as if by chance, in accusing Jesus Christ before Pilate, afforded Pilate a reason for sending Jesus Christ to Herod. And thereby the mystery was accomplished, that He should be judged by Jews and Gentiles. Chance was apparently the cause of the accomplishment of the mystery.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00771"><a id="p_744"/>744</h4>
<p>Those who have a difficulty in believing seek a reason in the fact that the Jews do not believe. "Were this so clear," say they, "why did the Jews not believe?" And they almost wish that they had believed, so as not to be kept back by the example of their refusal. But it is their very refusal that is the foundation of our faith. We should be much less disposed to the faith, if they were on our side. We should then have a more ample pretext. The wonderful thing is to have made the Jews great lovers of the things foretold, and great enemies of their fulfilment.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00772"><a id="p_745"/>745</h4>
<p>The Jews were accustomed to great and striking miracles, and so, having had the great miracles of the Red Sea and of the land of Canaan as an epitome of the great deeds of their Messiah, they therefore looked for more striking miracles, of which those of Moses were only the patterns.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00773"><a id="p_746"/>746</h4>
<p>The carnal Jews and the heathen have their calamities, and Christians also. There is no Redeemer for the heathen, for they do not so much as hope for one. There is no Redeemer for the Jews; they hope for Him in vain. There is a Redeemer only for Christians. (See <i>Perpetuity</i>.)</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00774"><a id="p_747"/>747</h4>
<p>In the time of the Messiah the people divided themselves. The spiritual embraced the Messiah, and the coarser-minded remained to serve as witnesses of Him.<a id="Page_225" class="pageno" title="[Pg 225]"/></p>

<p>"If this was clearly foretold to the Jews, how did they not believe it, or why were they not destroyed for resisting a fact so clear?"</p>
<p>I reply: in the first place, it was foretold both that they would not believe a thing so clear, and that they would not be destroyed. And nothing is more to the glory of the Messiah; for it was not enough that there should be prophets; their prophets must be kept above suspicion. Now, etc.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00776"><a id="p_749"/>749</h4>
<p>If the Jews had all been converted by Jesus Christ, we should have none but questionable witnesses. And if they had been entirely destroyed, we should have no witnesses at all.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00777"><a id="p_750"/>750</h4>
<p>What do the prophets say of Jesus Christ? That He will be clearly God? No; but that He is a God truly hidden; that He will be slighted; that none will think that it is He; that He will be a stone of stumbling, upon which many will stumble, etc. Let people then reproach us no longer for want of clearness, since we make profession of it.</p>
<p>But, it is said, there are obscurities.—And without that, no one would have stumbled over Jesus Christ, and this is one of the formal pronouncements of the prophets: <i>Excæca</i><a id="FNanchor_280_284"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@18269@18269-h@18269-h-12.htm.html#Footnote_280_284" class="fnanchor pginternal">[280]</a> ...</p>

<p>David: a great witness; a king, good, merciful, a beautiful soul, a sound mind, powerful. He prophesies, and his wonder comes to pass. This is infinite.</p>
<p>He had only to say that he was the Messiah, if he had been vain; for the prophecies are clearer about him than about Jesus Christ. And the same with Saint John.</p>

<p>The time of the first advent was foretold; the time of the second is not so; because the first was to be obscure, and the second is to be brilliant, and so manifest that even His enemies will recognise it.

<p>God, in order to cause the Messiah to be known by the good and not to be known by the wicked, made Him to be foretold in this manner. If the manner of the Messiah had been clearly foretold, there would have been no obscurity, even for the wicked. If the time had been obscurely foretold, there would have been obscurity, even for the good. For their [goodness of heart] would not have made them understand, for instance, that the closed <i>mem</i> signifies six hundred years.

<p>It would have been useless for Archimedes to have acted the prince in his books on geometry, although he was a prince.</p>
<p>It would have been useless for our Lord Jesus Christ to<a id="Page_235" class="pageno" title="[Pg 235]"/> come like a king, in order to shine forth in His kingdom of holiness. But He came there appropriately in the glory of His own order.</p>
<p>It is most absurd to take offence at the lowliness of Jesus Christ, as if His lowliness were in the same order as the greatness which He came to manifest. If we consider this greatness in His life, in His passion, in His obscurity, in His death, in the choice of His disciples, in their desertion, in His secret resurrection, and the rest, we shall see it to be so immense, that we shall have no reason for being offended at a lowliness which is not of that order.</p>
<p>But there are some who can only admire worldly greatness, as though there were no intellectual greatness; and others who only admire intellectual greatness, as though there were not infinitely higher things in wisdom.</p>
<p>All bodies, the firmament, the stars, the earth and its kingdoms, are not equal to the lowest mind; for mind knows all these and itself; and these bodies nothing.</p>
<p>All bodies together, and all minds together, and all their products, are not equal to the least feeling of charity. This is of an order infinitely more exalted.</p>
<p>From all bodies together, we cannot obtain one little thought; this is impossible, and of another order. From all bodies and minds, we cannot produce a feeling of true charity; this is impossible, and of another and supernatural order.</p>

<p>Why did Jesus Christ not come in a visible manner, instead of obtaining testimony of Himself from preceding prophecies? Why did He cause Himself to be foretold in types?</p>

<p>If Jesus Christ had only come to sanctify, all Scripture and all things would tend to that end; and it would be quite easy to convince unbelievers. If Jesus Christ had only come to blind, all His conduct would be confused; and we would have no means of convincing unbelievers. But as He came <i>in sanctificationem et in scandalum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_317_321"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@18269@18269-h@18269-h-12.htm.html#Footnote_317_321" class="fnanchor pginternal">[317]</a> as Isaiah says, we cannot convince unbelievers, and they cannot convince us.

<p>The style of the gospel is admirable in so many ways, and among the rest in hurling no invectives against the persecutors and enemies of Jesus Christ. For there is no such invective in any of the historians against Judas, Pilate, or any of the Jews.</p>
<p>If this moderation of the writers of the Gospels had been assumed, as well as many other traits of so beautiful a character, and they had only assumed it to attract notice, even if they had not dared to draw attention to it themselves, they would not have failed to secure friends, who would have made such remarks to their advantage. But as they acted thus without pretence, and from wholly disinterested motives, they did not point it out to any one; and I believe that many such facts have not been noticed till now, which is evidence of the natural disinterestedness with which the thing has been done.</p>

<p>Who has taught the evangelists the qualities of a perfectly heroic soul, that they paint it so perfectly in Jesus Christ? Why do they make Him weak in His agony? Do they not know how to paint a resolute death? Yes, for the same Saint Luke paints the death of Saint Stephen as braver than that of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>They make Him therefore capable of fear, before the necessity of dying has come, and then altogether brave.<a id="Page_237" class="pageno" title="[Pg 237]"/></p>

<p><i>Proof of Jesus Christ.</i>—The supposition that the apostles were impostors is very absurd. Let us think it out.

The heart of man is strangely inclined to fickleness, to change, to promises, to gain. However little any of them might have been led astray by all these attractions, nay more, by the fear of prisons, tortures, and death, they were lost. Let us follow up this thought.</p>

<p><i>The beginning.</i>—Miracles enable us to judge of doctrine, and doctrine enables us to judge of miracles.</p>
<p>There are false miracles and true. There must be a distinction, in order to know them; otherwise they would be useless. Now they are not useless; on the contrary, they are fundamental. Now the rule which is given to us must be such, that it does not destroy the proof which the true miracles give of the truth, which is the chief end of the miracles.</p>
<p>Moses has given two rules: that the prediction does not come to pass (Deut. xviii), and that they do not lead to idolatry (Deut. xiii); and Jesus Christ<a id="FNanchor_318_322"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@18269@18269-h@18269-h-12.htm.html#Footnote_318_322" class="fnanchor pginternal">[318]</a> one.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ has verified that He was the Messiah, never in verifying His doctrine by Scripture and the prophecies, but always by His miracles.</p>
<p>He proves by a miracle that He remits sins.</p>
<p>Rejoice not in your miracles, said Jesus Christ, but because your names are written in heaven.<a id="FNanchor_319_323"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@18269@18269-h@18269-h-12.htm.html#Footnote_319_323" class="fnanchor pginternal">[319]</a></p>
<p>If they believe not Moses, neither will they believe one risen from the dead.</p>
<p>Nicodemus recognises by His miracles that His teaching is of God. <i>Scimus quia venisti a Deo magister; nemo enim potest hæc signa facere quæ tu facis nisi Deus fuerit cum eo.</i><a id="FNanchor_320_324"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@18269@18269-h@18269-h-12.htm.html#Footnote_320_324" class="fnanchor pginternal">[320]</a> He does not judge of the miracles by the teaching, but of the teaching by the miracles.</p>
<p>The Jews had a doctrine of God as we have one of Jesus Christ, and confirmed by miracles. They were forbidden to believe every worker of miracles; and they were further commanded to have recourse to the chief priests, and to rely on them.</p>
<p>And thus, in regard to their prophets, they had all those reasons which we have for refusing to believe the workers of miracles.</p>
<p>And yet they were very sinful in rejecting the prophets, and Jesus Christ, because of their miracles; and they would not have been culpable, if they had not seen the miracles. <i>Nisi fecissem ... peccatum non haberent.</i><a id="FNanchor_321_325"/><a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@18269@18269-h@18269-h-12.htm.html#Footnote_321_325" class="fnanchor pginternal">[321]</a> Therefore all belief rests upon miracles.</p>
<p>Prophecy is not called miracle; as Saint John speaks of the first miracle in Cana, and then of what Jesus Christ says to the woman of Samaria, when He reveals to her all her hidden life.

<p><i>Title: How it happens that men believe so many liars, who say that they have seen miracles, and do not believe any of those who say that they have secrets to make men immortal, or restore youth to them.</i>—Having considered how it happens that so great credence is given to so many impostors, who say they have remedies, often to the length of men putting their lives into their hands, it has appeared to me that the true cause is that there are true remedies. For it would not be possible that there should be so many false remedies, and that so much faith should be placed in them, if there were none true. If there had never been any remedy for any ill, and all ills had been incurable, it is impossible that men should have imagined that they could give remedies, and still more impossible that so many others should have believed those who boasted of having remedies; in the same way as did a man boast of preventing<a id="Page_241" class="pageno" title="[Pg 241]"/> death, no one would believe him, because there is no example of this. But as there were a number of remedies found to be true by the very knowledge of the greatest men, the belief of men is thereby induced; and, this being known to be possible, it has been therefore concluded that it was. For people commonly reason thus: "A thing is possible, therefore it is"; because the thing cannot be denied generally, since there are particular effects which are true, the people, who cannot distinguish which among these particular effects are true, believe them all. In the same way, the reason why so many false effects are credited to the moon, is that there are some true, as the tide.</p>
<p>It is the same with prophecies, miracles, divination by dreams, sorceries, etc. For if there had been nothing true in all this, men would have believed nothing of them; and thus, instead of concluding that there are no true miracles because there are so many false, we must, on the contrary, say that there certainly are true miracles, since there are false, and that there are false miracles only because some are true. We must reason in the same way about religion; for it would not be possible that men should have imagined so many false religions, if there had not been a true one. The objection to this is that savages have a religion; but the answer is that they have heard the true spoken of, as appears by the deluge, circumcision, the cross of Saint Andrew, etc.</p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00846"><a id="p_817"/>817</h4>
<p>Having considered how it comes that there are so many false miracles, false revelations, sorceries, etc., it has seemed to me that the true cause is that there are some true; for it would not be possible that there should be so many false miracles, if there were none true, nor so many false revelations, if there were none true, nor so many false religions, if there were not one true. For if there had never been all this, it is almost impossible that men should have imagined it, and still more impossible that so many others should have believed it. But as there have been very great things true, and as they have been believed by great men, this impression has been the cause that nearly everybody is rendered capable of believing also the false. And thus, instead of concluding that there are no true miracles, since there are so many false, it must be said, on the contrary, that there are true miracles, since there are so many false; and that there are false ones only because there are true; and that<a id="Page_242" class="pageno" title="[Pg 242]"/> in the same way there are false religions because there is one true.—Objection to this: savages have a religion. But this is because they have heard the true spoken of, as appears by the cross of Saint Andrew, the deluge, circumcision, etc.—This arises from the fact that the human mind, finding itself inclined to that side by the truth, becomes thereby susceptible of all the falsehoods of this ...</p>
